Platos Closet
==============

Hello World! Welcome to the documentation for ``platos_closet``, a Python package for telling if a planet from the solar system could be detected by PLATO space mission.

representative for PLATO space mission. More details can be found in the `PLATO Definition Study Report (Red Book) <https://sci.esa.int/web/plato/-/59252-plato-definition-study-report-red-book>`_  

``platos_closet`` was developed as a part of the `CODE/ASTRO <https://semaphorep.github.io/codeastro/>`_ workshop by the authors.
